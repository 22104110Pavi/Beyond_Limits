Proposal of Idea: Beyond Limits
An AI-powered Learning Platform for Specially-Abled Students
1. Introduction
The current educational landscape often lacks inclusivity for students with disabilities, resulting in unmet learning needs. Beyond Limits aims to bridge this gap by developing an AI-powered platform that offers personalized, interactive learning experiences for students with diverse abilities. This innovative solution focuses on courses such as Science, Languages, and Art & Technology, while also incorporating art therapy to foster emotional well-being. The platform leverages AI and cloud technologies to ensure accessibility, engagement, and scalability.

2. Problem Statement
Students with disabilities often struggle with rigid, traditional educational frameworks that do not accommodate their unique learning needs. There is also a lack of adaptive learning paths and accessible tools for such students, which limits their academic potential and emotional growth. Additionally, many platforms do not provide inclusive opportunities for students to express their creativity or explore art therapy, which is crucial for mental well-being.
